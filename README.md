# Animating-Stuff
Well as a css beginner this is definitely harder than it should.


I'm trying to make a small front-end (cause hardcore css stuff) application.
I'm not really trying to make a serious application but trying to learn about css in general.
Though it ended in me frustrated as fuck doing this with absolute 100% error rate.
Though this stuff can be useful for yall maybe.
